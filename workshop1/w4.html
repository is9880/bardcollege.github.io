      "Presumably man's spirit should be elevated if he can better review his shady past and analyze more completely and objectively his present problems. He has built a civilization so complex that he needs to mechanize his records more fully if he is to push his experiment to its logical conclusion and not merely become bogged down part way there by overtaxing his limited memory. His excursions may be more enjoyable if he can reacquire the privilege of forgetting the manifold things he does not need to have immediately at hand, with some assurance that he can find them again if they prove important."

<blockquote>
	Franco Berardi speaks on the codes that are instilled in life and culture to instruct how individuals act and interact.
	Today, a great deal of the codes we have are unspoken ones.  Personally, the code that allows members of the queer 
	community to recognize each other in situations where their sexuality does not make itself immediately apparent is 
	something that effects my interactions profoundly.  Codes function to give an individual a basis for action, and a way 
	to recognize the people who share their habitus and culture.  In directing and defining interactions and lifestyles 
	codes also dictate the future- how a community will develop, by what rules they will continue to operate under.  
	<br>To code is to create a set of implicit instructions; ones that are memorized as directions.  They function in technology in
	the same way as they do in life; it can just be easier to see the ones that affect <i>us</i> personally compared to the ones 
	that dictate all that we do with technology.  
	<br>There is code in nature that dictates when plants bloom, where birds fly to in the wintertime, when the cicadas emerge 
	from their 17 year slumber and awaken the world.  In college, there is code that dictates what you can and can’t say to a new 
	acquaintance, when it’s acceptable to sit with someone you don’t know, how you can approach them.  These are all codes written 
	in communities and recognized as rules that function to make things run smoother. 
	<br>Code can, of course, be <u>rewritten</u>.  This changes the rules, eradicating the past and dictating an entirely new set
	of guidelines to follow.  In the world of technological code this change is <b>easy</b>- <u><b>it is a shift of lines, 
	a revising of CSS or HTML but in life the change in codes for communities, individuals, or species is gradual.</u></b>
	<br>Coding can also be employed in media as a form of subconscious acknowledgement.  Like queer coding: a subtle nod to the 
	subtext of a character that writers might use to bait viewers with no intention of following through on explicitly 
	acknowledging what has been written under the surface.  It’s also used to create associations between different subjects (i.e.
	villains being coded as queer.)
